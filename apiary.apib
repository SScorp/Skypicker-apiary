# Skypicker.com API
Skypicker.com flights search API.

The default api endpoint is api.skypicker.com . You have to use https, always.
Currently, SLLv3 is disabled. Use TLS 1, 1.1 or 1.2 in your client config, if you get a handshake error response.

To implement the basic search, you need only the /places and /flights API calls.

To implement also the booking API, you need to use the booking_token hash containing all the needed flights data and pass it as parameters to check flights and also to save booking calls.

The places call contains the list of Skypicker API IDs, which are accepted by the /flights call in the flyFrom and to parameters. Basically, the IDs are the IATA airport and ISO country codes, 
but Skypicker uses also its own IDs as the engine can do very specific searches (currently anywhere and there could be other geo areas specified - "To the sea", "To party places" etc)

# Partner implementation notes

Use the parameter partner=picky for testing your implementation. Before going live, your account manager will assign your custom partner ID to you.

There is no development API, as most of the queries are simple GET requests that are not changing the state of any resource (except save_booking).
Feel free to use api.skypicker.com for the implementation and also testing.

Currently, all of our flights are economy class. We consider for now each passenger as an adult.

#### Places
The basic places call is this

https://api.skypicker.com/places

#### Search
The basic flights call could look like this

https://api.skypicker.com/flights?flyFrom=CZ&to=OPO&dateFrom=10/10/2014&dateTo=20/10/2014&partner=picky

If there is the partner parameter specified, the response will contain the link directly to Skypicker booking, where user can book the specified flight.

For more specific searches and filters continue to this apiary specification, where every available parameter is described.


# GET /places{/id,?term,?locale, ?zoomLevelThreshold, ?bounds,?v}

Returns the list of Skypicker api ids. This ids has to be used in the SP search (flights API call)
From v2 (May 2014) flights also accepts parameters for city areas (LON,PAR...), even if they dont appear in the places call

+ Parameters
    + id = `SK` (optional, string) ... if given, the call returns the details only for the one specific id
    + term = `br` (optional, string) ... used for suggestions of geo names,"br" returns city, airport codes or country names beginning with br
    + locale = `cs` (optional, string) ... the locale of geo names in response, default is en
    + zoomLevelThreshold = `3` (optional, integer) ... zoom level on which this place should be shown
    + bounds = `lat_lo,lng_lo,lat_hi,lng_hi` (optional, string) ... filter only places in these bounds. "lo" corresponds to the southwest corner of the bounding box, "hi" corresponds to the northeast corner of that box
    + v = `1` (optional, integer)  ... the api version, from v2 it returns the new api ids for the whole world.

+ Request
    { "term":"BRQ" }

+ Response 200

A single flights search.

The google flights like filters (price_from,price_to and the next ones) are not well documented and even not tested for properly functioning, yet.

# POST /flights_multi{/requests}

This call is able to do multi-city searches in parallel. The single search queries dont have to be connected in any way.

Accepts the same parameters as the /flights API call.

To do a request, send a POST json payload with a list of API parameters for each search query.

A sample python code for this call could look like the following

```
import requests

query_list = [
    {'to': 'MAD', 'flyFrom': 'BRQ', 'directFlights': 1, 'dateFrom': '29/05/2015', 'dateTo': '29/05/2015'},
    {'to': 'PRG', 'flyFrom': 'MAD', 'directFlights': 1, 'dateFrom': '30/05/2015', 'dateTo': '30/05/2015'}
]

print requests.post('https://api.skypicker.com/flights_multi', data = json.dumps({'requests': r}) ).json()
```

In the response root, the results field contains a list of responses for the posted queries. Each single element contains the same response as it would be a /flights API call.

The total_price is the sum of all the prices.

The main_booking_token in the response root should be used for booking the flights, instead the booking_token in each single search query result.



# GET /deep{/from,to,?departure,?return,?lang,?currency,?price,?affilid,?passengers,?flightsId}

Skypicker uses its own URL address format and it is specific for every language and can be used in many ways.

If you dont want to deal with the creation of those addresses, use this API call, which will take the given parameters and make redirect to the correct URL

In most cases, you dont need to use this call, as the deeplink is already returned in the flights call, when the partner parameter is specified

+ Parameters
    + from (required, string) ... flyfrom, airport code
    + to (required, string) ... the destination, accepts airport codes only
    + departure (optional, string) ... the departure date
    + return (optional, string) ... return date
    + lang (optional, string) ... language (based on that cheap-flights, vuelos-baratoos, levne-lety will appear in the url address)
    + currency (optional, string) ... currency
    + price (optional, string) ... price, specify in the given currency
    + affilid (optional, string) ... your affiliate id
    + passengers (optional, integer) ... number of passengers
    + flightsId (optional, string) ... the flight/trip id returned from the flights call

+ Response 301


# GET /check_flights{/pnum,?bnum,?flights}

Checks the prices of given flights in realtime. Returns all the data about flights


## Basic SP booking flow (simplified)
1. call check_flights until flights_check is not True
2. watch for flights_invalid to be False (if this is going to be True, one or more of the flights doesnt exist anymore and the whole trip is unbookable)
3. if flights_check is True and flights_invalid is False, book the flight with the save_booking API call and pay for it with one of the payment options


## Flow used on frontend (as an working implementation example)


1. User opens the flight details, this could be done by a) clicking on "Book" in results b) accessing url that contains flight_id

2. Front-end calls /check_flight to get information about flight (not just check, as the name suggest, but all the information)

3. Front-end renders the Summary view about flight and booking form

4. Front-end repeatedly calls /check_flight (every 15s) and update Summary (price can change)... it also remembers flight_checked from last response

5. Front-end also manually calls /check_flight when user changes some important booking input (number of passengers, number of bags)


```
If front-end receives flight_invalid = true in any response, it will exit booking form.

flight_checked value is only for remembered, but not yet acted upon
```

## After the User clicks on "Book" button

1. Form validation happens, if everything is OK, go to next step, otherwise prompt user to check form

2. If last value of flight_check was false, wait for next response of /check_flight and try to repeat

3. Only if last response of /check_flight flight_checked was true, Front-end will send form to /save_booking back-end

4. Back-end should check price on its own and only return successful response if price was checked, if price cannot be checked, return error message (code 510)

5. If front-end will receive success from /save_booking, it will show payment options.

6. In the meantime, periodic /check_flight still occurs and if flight_invalid is sent from backend, booking is exited on front-end




+ Parameters
    + pnum = `1` (required, integer) ... number of passengers
    + bnum = `0` (required, integer) ... number of bags
    + affily (optional, string) ... the affil ID
    + booked_at (optional, string) ... the ID of the site, where the booking was made. In most of cases, same as affily. The difference is, that affily can contain also any subIDs, while booked_at is only the basic partner ID
    + realtime (required, boolean) ... Try to avoid using this. Set to True for cases, when check flights cant be repeated or you want the response asap
    + booking_token (optional, string) ... the hash obtained from the /flights API call results

+ Response 200
